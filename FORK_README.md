**What Is This Fork In Here For?**

This fork is in the kstreet GitHub account because the fork is the copy that is referenced and currently used with:

- A private `.MvxPlugins` project needs references to the `Cheesebaron.MvxPlugins.ModernHttpClient.*` projects
- `Street.MvxPlugins.DeviceInfo` needs to review code changes in `Cheesebaron.MvxPlugins.AppId` to keep itself current

**How Fresh Is This?**

- The code in this fork was current/similar to the `Cheesebaron.MvxPlugins`
 repo up through [this December 6, 2013 commit](https://github.com/Cheesebaron/Cheesebaron.MvxPlugins/commit/e748a997ea45e68aef79c2269cdaca66e29fc9ed).
